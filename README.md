# Exploratory Data Analysis
This project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on ** Univariate, ** Bivariate, and ** Multivariate variables in the given dataset below.

## Research Question
Figuring out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.
## User Requirements
Python Notebook with Jupyter for the analysis
## Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analysis since we describe only 1 individual variable. 
This type of analysis does not deal with causes and relationships and its main purpose is to describe the data and find patterns within it. 
For example, given a dataset that has patient names and their corresponding weights we can only do a univariate analysis on the data since we only have 1 variable (weight). 
In this case, we can determine patterns associated with the variable by summarizing the data.

There are a couple of ways to conduct univariate analysis, such as;

1.Frequency distribution
2.Central tendency (Mean,Median and Mode)
3.Dispersion(Standard deviation, Variance, Quartiles, Range...)
## Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate data involves two different variables. 
The analysis of this type of data (known as Bivariate Analysis) deals with causes and relationships between two variables.

There are 3  types of bivariate analysis based on the data type;

1.Numerical & Numerical - When performing bivariate analysis on two variables that are both numerical
2.Categorical & Categorical - When performing bivariate analysis on two variables that are both categorical
3.Numerical & Categorical - When performing bivariate analysis on two variables( numerical and categorical)
##Multivariate Analysis
This is a statistical analysis that involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time.

The techniques used for Multivariate Analysis are:

Principal component analysis -  This is a statistical analysis that transforms a number of correlated variables into a (smaller) number of uncorrelated variables called principal components.
Factor analysis - This is a statistical analysis that involves grouping similar variables into dimensions so as to make a large dataset more manageable and more understandable.
Discriminant analysis - This is a statistical analysis that is used to analyze the dataset when the dependent variable is categorical and the independent variable is continuous. 
## Exploratory Data Analysis Process

There are a few basic steps to follow when becoming familiar with a new dataset

###Explore
In this step, we are basically looking missing data ( "Null") and other anomalies like duplicates, incorrect data and other suspicious observations.
Itâ€™s also a good idea to take a look at the distribution of data values for outliers and skewness.
Additionally, other outputs from this phase may include some exploratory visualization.
###Clean / Verify
Once we have a gotten a good grasp of the anomalies within our data, then we can begin to deal with them.
Generally, we'll need to utilize some method of fixing, imputing, or removing problematic data.
###Document/ Save
Finally, we'd want to save our clean dataset in a safe place.
